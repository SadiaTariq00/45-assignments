// Conditional Tests: Write a series of conditional tests. Print a statement describing each test and your prediction for the results of each test. Your code should look something like this:

// let car = 'subaru';

// console.log("Is car == 'subaru'? I predict True.")

// console.log(car == 'subaru')

// • Look closely at your results, and make sure you understand why each line evaluates to True or False.

// • Create at least 10 tests. Have at least 5 tests evaluate to True and another 5 tests evaluate to False.

let four = 4;
let six = 6 ;

//Test 1
console.log("Test 1: four is equal to 4");
console.log(four == 4);

//Test 2
console.log("Test 2: six is equal to 6");
console.log(six == 6);

//Test 3
console.log("Test 3: four is not equal to 6");
console.log(four !== 6);

// Test 4
console.log("Test 4: six is greater than 4");
console.log(six > 4);

// Test 5
console.log("Test 5: four is less than 6");
console.log(four < 6);

//  Test 6
console.log("Test 6: six is less than 4");
console.log(six < 4);

//  Test 7
console.log("Test 7: four is equal to 6");
console.log(four == 6);


//  Test 8
console.log("Test 8: four is not equal to 4");
console.log(four !== 4);

//  Test 9
console.log("Test 9: four is greater than 6");
console.log(four > six);

//  Test 10
console.log("Test 10: six is not equal to 6");
console.log(six !== 6);
